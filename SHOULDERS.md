# Docs Stands on the Shoulders of Giants

The `docs` site does not try to reinvent the wheel!

Instead, it uses the already great wheels developed by the cloud-native community and puts them all together in the best way possible.

Without these giants, this project would not be possible.

There are to many to list here, but links are provided in the docs where possible.
