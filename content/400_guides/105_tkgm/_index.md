{{< notice tip >}}VMware has decided to offer a free download of VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in place of VMware Tanzu Community Edition software and to retire the Tanzu Community Edition open source project. You can download VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Community [here](https://www.vmware.com/go/get-tkg). Some of the content in this section may still be applicable to Tanzu Kuberneted Grid but was originally written for Tanzu Community Edition.
