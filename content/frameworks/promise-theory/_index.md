## Overview

Promise Theory, in the context of information science, is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual, autonomous actors or agents who publish their intentions to one another in the form of promises.

It is a form of labelled _graph theory_, describing discrete networks of agents joined by the unilateral promises they make.

You may have used Promise Theory concepts without even realizing it. _CFEngine_, the grandfather of configuration management was one of the first tools to implement these techniques.
