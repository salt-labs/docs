## Emerging Architecture Patterns

With the rapid evolution of technology and the growing demand for flexibility, scalability, and resilience, various emerging architecture patterns are gaining traction. Some noteworthy patterns from WSO2 include:

### Cell-Based Architecture

The [Cell-Based Architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/reference-architecture-cell-based.md) is a pattern that focuses on creating self-contained, independently deployable components called "cells." Each cell encapsulates all the required functionality, data, and APIs, promoting agility, scalability, and fault tolerance.

### Agile Integration: Cell-Based Architecture

In this [emerging pattern for agile integration](https://wso2.com/library/conference/2018/11/wso2con-eu-2018-an-emerging-architecture-pattern-for-agile-integration-cell-based-architecture/), the cell-based architecture is leveraged to build highly modular, composable systems that can be easily adapted to changing requirements. This approach emphasizes the importance of rapid, iterative development and continuous delivery.

### Layered and Segmented Architecture

The [Layered and Segmented Architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/reference-architecture-layered-segmented.md) pattern organizes applications into distinct layers and segments, each with a specific purpose and set of responsibilities. This pattern helps improve maintainability, extensibility, and separation of concerns.

### Cloud Native Digital Enterprise

The [Cloud Native Digital Enterprise](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/reference-cloud-native-architecture-digital-enterprise.md) pattern emphasizes the adoption of cloud-native technologies, practices, and culture to build highly scalable, resilient, and adaptable systems. This approach facilitates the development of innovative, customer-centric applications that can thrive in the rapidly changing digital landscape.

### API-driven Microservice Architecture

The [API-driven Microservice Architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/api-driven-microservice-architecture.md) pattern focuses on using APIs as the primary means of communication between microservices. This approach promotes loose coupling, interoperability, and a well-defined contract for each service, simplifying integration and facilitating change.

### Event-driven Microservice Architecture

The [Event-driven Microservice Architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/event-driven-api-architecture.md) pattern is based on the principle of asynchronous communication between microservices using events. This approach enables better scalability, loose coupling, and real-time processing of data, making it suitable for systems with high throughput and low latency requirements.
