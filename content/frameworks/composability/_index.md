## Overview

Composability is a system design principle that focuses on the inter-relationships of components within a system. It emphasizes the creation of modular, reusable components that can be easily assembled or reassembled to form new systems or adapt to changing requirements. Composable systems are designed to promote flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility.

### Key Concepts of Composability

1. **Modularity**: Composable systems are built using independent, self-contained components that encapsulate specific functionality.
2. **Reusability**: Components in a composable system can be reused in various contexts and configurations, reducing duplication and promoting consistency.
3. **Interoperability**: Composable components are designed to work together seamlessly, ensuring smooth communication and integration between different parts of the system.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component in a composable system is responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality, simplifying the design and making it easier to reason about and maintain.
