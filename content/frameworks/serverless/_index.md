## Overview

The serverless pattern is an architectural style that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. It auto-scales your application, you are billed only for the resources consumed during execution and it eliminates the need for server software and hardware management.

## Advantages of Serverless

1. **Scalability**: Serverless applications can scale automatically to handle high traffic loads and then scale down when traffic decreases.
2. **Cost-Efficiency**: You pay only for the compute time you consume, there is no charge when your code is not running.
3. **Developer Productivity**: Without servers to manage, developers can focus on writing code and delivering features.
4. **Performance**: Serverless architectures are designed to handle high traffic loads and can spin up new function instances as demand increases.
5. **Reduced Overhead**: Serverless eliminates the need for server maintenance, patching, and capacity planning.

## Disadvantages of Serverless

1. **Cold Start**: Serverless functions might take longer to respond after periods of inactivity, this phenomenon is known as a "cold start".
2. **Debugging and Monitoring**: Traditional debugging and monitoring tools don't always work well in a serverless environment.
3. **Vendor Lock-in**: Applications built with serverless architectures can become tightly coupled to the specific cloud provider's services and tools.
4. **Latency**: For high-frequency applications, the time taken to spin up a new function instance can introduce latency.
5. **State Management**: Serverless functions are stateless, maintaining state between invocations can be challenging.
