## Overview

Cloud-native engineering architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built to take full advantage of the cloud computing model.

Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These methodologies facilitate the creation of loosely coupled systems that offer resilience, manageability, and observability. When combined with extensive automation, cloud-native technologies enable engineers to implement high-impact changes frequently and consistently, while minimizing manual effort and potential errors.

## Advantages of Cloud-Native Engineering

### Scalability

Cloud-native applications are designed to scale horizontally, allowing them to handle increased load efficiently. This is achieved through techniques such as containerization, which enables applications to be distributed across multiple nodes.

### Flexibility

By leveraging microservices, cloud-native applications can be developed, deployed, and updated independently, without affecting the entire system. This enables faster development cycles and greater adaptability to changing business requirements.

### Resilience

Cloud-native systems are designed to be fault-tolerant, ensuring continuous operation even in the face of failures. Techniques such as service meshes and immutable infrastructure help to minimize the impact of failures on the overall system.

### Observability and Manageability

Cloud-native applications are designed to provide better visibility into system health and performance. Tools and practices such as monitoring, logging, and tracing enable engineers to identify and resolve issues quickly and efficiently.

### Automation

Automating processes and tasks, such as CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure provisioning, minimizes manual intervention and reduces the potential for human error. Automation also enables more frequent and predictable changes to the system, enhancing its stability and reliability.

## Key Concepts and Components

### Containers

Containers are lightweight, portable units that package an application's code, dependencies, and runtime environment, ensuring consistency across different computing environments.

### Service Meshes

A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that manages and controls the communication between microservices. It provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and security policies, helping to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.

### Microservices

Microservices are a modular architectural style that breaks down applications into smaller, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality, making the system more manageable and easier to update.

### Immutable Infrastructure

Immutable infrastructure is an approach to managing infrastructure where components are replaced rather than updated. This ensures a consistent and predictable environment, reducing the potential for configuration drift and increasing system stability.

### Declarative APIs

Declarative APIs allow developers to specify the desired end state of a system, rather than the steps required to achieve that state. This simplifies the process of managing complex systems and makes it easier to automate tasks and processes.
