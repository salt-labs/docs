## Overview

The Salt Orchestrator is a tool that can be used to execute in-order operations.

One common use case is to bootstrap a new environment. The Salt Orchestrator can be used to create the scaffolding for the environment, deploy the Salt-Master, configure the Salt-Master, and then deploy the rest of the environment.
