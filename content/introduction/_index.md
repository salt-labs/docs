## Overview

Welcome to the __Salt Labs__ documentation website.

Many projects are adopting cloud-native principles, which is a rapidly evolving space.

This site is an attempt to bring together and share some of the resources we have found useful at __Salt Labs__ on our journey assisting customers with their _cloud native_ journey.

After several times searching for an error code or blog post and wondering _haven't I solved this before_ only to find a forum post by one of the team asking or answering that same question, we decided to try and capture some of this information centrally.

__Be warned__, we don't promise to update this frequently, but we do hope you at least find some of the content useful.

## What can you find here?

Frameworks, tutorials, and resources on specific technologies that we find on our travels and want to remember or feel others might find useful.

## What doesn't belong here?

There is no customer or project specific information to be found here.
