## Overview

Welcome to the __Salt Labs__ documentation website.

Many projects are adopting cloud-native principles, which is a rapidly evolving space.

This site is an attempt to bring together and share some of the resources we have found useful at __Salt Labs__ on our journey assisting customers with their _cloud native_ journey.

After several times searching for an error code or blog post and wondering _haven't I solved this before_ only to find a forum post by one of the team asking the same question, we decided to try and capture some of this information centrally.

Although we don't claim to update this frequently, we hope you at least find some of it useful.

## What can you find here?

Frameworks, tutorials, and resources on specific technologies that we find on our travels and want to remember or share with the community.

## What doesn't belong here?

There is no customer or project specific information to be found here.
