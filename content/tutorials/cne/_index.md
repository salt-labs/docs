## Overview

Are you interested in becoming a _Cloud Native Engineer?_ Do you want to learn more about the tools and technologies that are used to build cloud native applications?

If so, you have come to the right place. This document is a collection of resources and techniques that will help you along your journey.

The goal is not to prescribe specific technologies (as there are too many and they change frequently) but to provide a general overview of the cloud native development process with **examples** of concepts and tools in different areas to help you finding a path to achieve your goals.

But first, what exactly is a _Cloud Native Engineer?_

{{< notice note >}}
_A cloud native engineer (CNE) is responsible for taking an application from source in a repository through to deployment via a continuous integration and delivery pipeline._

During this journey, the CNE ensures that the code builds, tests pass and the application gets safely and securely deployed up to the production environment.

The list of relevant technologies in this space is _overwhelming_. Just check out the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="blank">CNCF Landscape</a> to get an idea on _some of_ them. _But don't panic, you don't need to know them all!_.

When it comes to product selection, there isn't _one_ answer to an often asked question, _what is the best toolchain to learn?_ The technologies and skills required will vary based on a number of factors.

Some of these factors are outlined in the next sections to give you an idea about areas of focus for any CNE.

CNE's need to have a broad range of knowledge across several key areas and should aim to have experience with one or more technologies in each area.
