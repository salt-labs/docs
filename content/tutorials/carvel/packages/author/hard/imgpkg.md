Now it's time to push the imgpkg bundle that you have created locally to the image registry as an OCI compatible image.

For further documentation on the imgpkg available options see [carvel.dev/imgpkg](https://carvel.dev/imgpkg/docs/develop/).

- First, let's define metadata about the `bundle`

{{< tabs "imgpkg-metadata" >}}

{{< tab "Linux" >}}

```bash
cat <<- _EOF_ > "${ROOT_DIR}/packages/${PACKAGE_NAME}/${PACKAGE_VERSION}/bundle/.imgpkg/bundle.yml"
---
apiVersion: imgpkg.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Bundle

metadata:
  name: ${PACKAGE_NAME}

authors:
  - name: ${PACKAGE_AUTHOR}
    email: ${PACKAGE_AUTHOR_EMAIL}

websites:
  - url: ${PACKAGE_WEBSITE}
_EOF_
```

- Push the imgpkg bundle to your image registry so it's ready for consumption.

{{< tabs "imgpkg-push" >}}

{{< tab "Linux" >}}

```bash
imgpkg push  \
  --file "${ROOT_DIR}/packages/${PACKAGE_NAME}/${PACKAGE_VERSION}/bundle/" \
  --bundle ${OCI_REGISTRY}/${OCI_PROJECT}/packages/${PACKAGE_NAME}:${PACKAGE_VERSION} \
  --lock-output "${ROOT_DIR}/packages/${PACKAGE_NAME}/${PACKAGE_VERSION}/BundleLock.yaml" \
  --registry-ca-cert-path "${HOME}/.docker/certs.d/${OCI_REGISTRY}/ca.crt"
```
