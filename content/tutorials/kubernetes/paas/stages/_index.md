## Overview

The stages of a Kubernetes PaaS project.

### Stage 1: Discovery and Assessment

- Assess the existing infrastructure and applications
- Identify requirements and constraints
- Perform a skills gap analysis to determine training needs
- Evaluate current CI/CD processes

### Stage 2: Planning and Design

- Define the target architecture for the Kubernetes cluster
- Design the network topology and security policies
- Select the appropriate storage and compute resources
- Plan for cluster scalability and disaster recovery

### Stage 3: Infrastructure Setup

- Deploy VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid
- Configure vSphere and NSX-T for networking and security
- Set up storage classes and persistent volumes
- Prepare infrastructure for cluster monitoring and logging

### Stage 4: Kubernetes Deployment and Configuration

- Deploy and configure Kubernetes clusters using TKG
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and namespaces
- Set up ingress and egress controls
- Configure cluster autoscaling
- Develop CI/CD pipelines for Core Services
- Package and deploy all Core Services
- Implement Cluster observability tooling and incident management process
- Implement Cluster Backup and Recovery tooling and processes

### Stage 5: Application Migration and Modernization

- Containerize applications and create Kubernetes manifests
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for deployment and rollback
- Test and validate application functionality on the new cluster
- Migrate applications in a phased approach.

### Stage 6: Monitoring, Logging, and Security

- Integrate application monitoring and logging tools.
- Implement security best practices and policies
- Set up alerts and notifications for critical events
- Regularly audit and update security configurations
- Continue to harden through continual improvement processes.

### Stage 7: Training and Documentation

- Train the IT and development teams on Kubernetes and TKG
- Refine and maintain documentation for infrastructure, applications, and processes
- Develop runbooks and playbooks for common tasks and incident response

### Stage 8: Continuous Improvement and Optimization

- Continuously monitor cluster performance and optimize resource usage
- Implement cost control measures and optimize infrastructure spending
- Keep up-to-date with Kubernetes and TKG features and updates
- Regularly review and update processes and policies
- Throughout the stages, ensure that you prioritize tasks based on dependencies and business impact. Collaborate closely with stakeholders, consider organizational goals, and allocate resources accordingly.
