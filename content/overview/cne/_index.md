Cloud-native engineering architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built to take full advantage of the cloud computing model.

Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable.

Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.
