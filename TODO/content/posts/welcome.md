## Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Native Engineering Handbook!

Many projects are adopting cloud-native principles, which is an ever evolving space.

Rather than re-learn and re-create the same material from scratch across projects, this site is an attempt to bring together and share some of the resources we find useful.

## What can you find here?

Frameworks, tutorials, and resources on specific technologies that we find on our travels and want to share with the community.

## What doesn't belong here?

There should be no customer or project specific information held here.
